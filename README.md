## Description
The Productivity Manager is an intuitive application designed to assist users in effectively managing their daily tasks and appointments. By providing a user-friendly interface, it streamlines scheduling and organization, optimizing productivity and time management. This innovative solution eliminates the reliance on conventional planning methods, offering a customizable and accessible digital alternative. Throughout the development process, I got  firsthand experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also harnessing the power of popular frameworks such as Bootstrap and jQuery to enhance functionality and user experience.
